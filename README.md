# My dotfiles
These are my scripts & dotfiles for gentoo with dwm.

Apps I use, in no particular order:

weechat, st, qutebrowser, zathura, newsboat, neovim, mpd, ncmpcpp, emacs(sometimes), vifm, neomutt (with mutt-wizard, lemonbar, dzen.

## Scripts
All scripts can be found in ~/scripts, here's a rundown of the scripts I use regularly.

-quicktex: If you've got some latex code in your clipboard, it quickly compiles and previews it.

-mpdmenu: Little dmenu script to interact with mpd.

-dmenu_run_history: Found on suckless.org, dmenu_run with history.

-yorn.sh: Yes or No prompt to incorporate in other scripts

-curcourses: Lets me quickly open pdf's I'm reading with zathura in tabbed, I can also easily add courses with this script.

-lemonbar/dwm/bar.sh: Lemonbar I use in conjuction with my dwm patch, also bits of dzen2 in there.

-dwm_tab: Working on it...

-lemonbar/bar.sh: Sometimes I use bspwm, then I use this bar.
