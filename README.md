# Setup
I mostly just use bspwm with lemonbar and a few scripts you can find in the scripts/ folder
## Screenshot for bspwm
![](./bspwm-screenshot.png)

Scripts for bspwm (especially bar script) are under scripts/lemonbar/bspwm and scripts/bspwm.

Scripts I use for lectures/note taking are in scripts/lectures

All other script names should be somewhat self explanatory.
